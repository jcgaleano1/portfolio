Hi, thanks to visit my portfolio. I'm Johan Galeano from Bogot√°, Colombia.

In this portfolio I am showing my projects and something about me, it takes me a long period because it was difficult to think about a special design or something attractive, with many tools, but now I have the opportunity to present this to other people and I am proud to have finished it, it was challenging. This portfolio was created with technologies such as react, html, css and some repositories that helped me to finish.

I'd like to work in the frontend part because I consider there are many designs to apply, many animations to do and it's necessary to put your creativity. I'll be willing to learn every day.
