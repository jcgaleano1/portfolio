I'm from Colombia, Bogot√° and I am in love with programming because I consider there are many ways to build awesome web pages with animations and colors. <br /><br />
            Previously I finished a Technician in Software programing and I did some courses on Javascript, Html, Css and others like Node, Mongo, MySql and a little bit of Java and Python. This has inspired me to continue this great career. I am currently studying a technology in analysis and development of information systems.  <br /> <br />
            Although I don't have real work experience, I have developed some projects and at the moment I would like to adquire more experience and start in this wonderfull world, I know I have the skills to do it and I'll be willing to do my best. </p>
